The second release in the recently started 3.2 series is now [available on GitHub][1].
You will find there archives with the library sources and
documentation as well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as
[Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/),
[MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/) and
[TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/). You can also read the
[updated documentation][2] for this version and, in particular, if you're
new to wxWidgets, you may find the [installation guide][3] a good starting
point.

### Changes in this release

Coming soon after 3.2.0, this is mostly a bug fix release, with just one
noteworthy new feature: the addition of [wxFileDialog::AddShortcut()][4] function.
However it fixes some important regressions and other problems:

- Fix crash in applications calling `g_log_set_writer_func()` with recent glib.
- Several fixes to alpha channel handling in wxMSW bitmaps.
- Generate key and focus events for `wxSearchCtrl` in wxOSX.
- Fix creating wxRadioBox without any items in wxOSX.
- Fix regression with AUI floating pane positioning.
- Avoid new warnings given by gcc 12.
- Fix building with MSVS 2022 standard-conforming preprocessor.
- Work around MSVS 2022 optimizer bug that broke `wxImage` resizing.
- NetBSD build fixes.

This release is API and ABI-compatible with 3.2.0, so the existing
applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the fixes
above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.
