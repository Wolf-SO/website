Utah C++ Programmers group has released a new video about [porting from MFC to
wxWidgets][1] accompanied by a gist with a [step-by-step guide][2].

Hopefully this can be useful to people who want to make their existing MFC
applications portable or just to switch to a more actively maintained
framework.
