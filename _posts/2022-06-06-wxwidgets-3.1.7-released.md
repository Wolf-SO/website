wxWidgets 3.1.7 release is now
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.1.7).
You will find there archives with the library sources and documentation as
well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as [Microsoft Visual
C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/)
and [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/).

Please notice that while 3.1.7 is officially a "development" version because
it is not fully compatible with the "stable" 3.0.x, the list of backwards
incompatible changes is very short, so you shouldn't have any problems
updating to this version from 3.0.x in practice, and you're encouraged to use
this release, including in production.

This is also the last release before the upcoming 3.2.0 release that will be
the start of a new API and ABI-stable wxWidgets version, so please test your
existing applications with this version and let us know about any problems
and, especially, regressions, so that they could still be fixed before 3.2.0.

### Changes in this release

This release, coming only two months after the previous one, mostly
contains bug fixes and incremental improvements in preparation for 3.2.0
major release. There is still quite a number of them, with more than 500
commits from 37 unique contributors, but the most important changes are:

- CMake build system improvements (better precompiled headers support).
- New [wxFileDialog customization API][1] working with `IFileDialog` in wxMSW.
- Many updated translations and new [wxTRANSLATE_IN_CONTEXT()][2].
- Fixes for bad interactions with new macOS 12 features in wxOSX.
- Several previously missing attributes added to multiple XRC handlers.
- Row reordering by dragging and UI enhancements in `wxGrid`.
- Ability to suppress selected (or all) GTK warning messages in wxGTK.
- And many, many bugs fixes, including for the regressions in 3.1.6.
