### Changes since 3.2.1

This release comes only a few months after the previous 3.2.1, but contains
an important number of bug fixes and enhancements, further improving high DPI
support, including:

- Better window resizing on DPI change in wxMSW.
- Fix using native icons returned by `wxArtProvider`.
- Fix menu items using custom font in high DPI.
- High resolution icons support in `wxGenericTreeCtrl` and `wxGenericListCtrl`.

and also improving locale-related code under Mac and Unix systems:

- `wxUILocale::UseDefault()` works for locales using different language and
  region under Mac and fails when used for unsupported locale under Unix.
- New `wxUILocale::GetSystemLocaleId()` allows to retrieve such locales IDs.
- `wxUILocale::GetCurrent()` works currently for "C" locale under Mac.

Some other user-visible enhancements made in this release:

- Allow selecting and copying text in `wxMessageDialog` in wxGTK.
- Improve size and behaviour of in-place editor in `wxGenericTreeCtrl`.
- Fix sometimes missing overwrite prompt in "Save" file dialog in wxMSW.
- Fix glitch in drawing wxStaticBox with a control as label in wxMSW.

There are also some important bug fixes:

- Fix regression in saving TIFF images that could end up truncated.
- Fix long standing bug in parsing wxHTTP responses.
- Fix data race when processing events generated in a worker thread.
- Avoid appending extraneous NUL bytes to `wxTextDataObject` text in wxMSW.
- Fix handling of fonts with fractional sizes in wxOSX.
- Fix resizing `wxGLCanvas` with EGL and Wayland in wxGTK.
- Fix display artefacts when using AUI without compositor under X11.
- Work around crashes when using `wxTextCtrl` with MinGW TDM 64.
- Fix for a possible crash when handling menu events under Mac.
- Third-party libraries have been updated to the latest versions.

All in all, this release includes ~150 fixes from 27 unique contributors,
please see the full [change log][] for more details.

This release is API and ABI-compatible with the previous 3.2.x releases, so
the existing applications don't even need to be rebuilt to profit from all the
fixes above if they use shared/dynamic libraries. And if they do need to be
recompiled, this can be done without any changes to the code.
