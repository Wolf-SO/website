wxWidgets 3.2.0 release candidate is now [available on GitHub][1].
This release is not perfect (we might need a few more years for this), but if
no catastrophic problems are discovered, it will soon officially become 3.2.0,
starting the next ABI-stable release series -- the first one since the release
of 3.0.0 almost 9 years ago.

Please help us with testing this release by [reporting any problems][1],
especially new ones, in it, so that we could still fix them before the final
3.2.0, without waiting for another decade to do it in 3.4.0. Thanks in advance!
