wxWidgets 3.1.6 release is now
[available on GitHub](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/releases/tag/v3.1.6).
You will find there archives with the library sources and documentation as
well as binaries for the selected Windows compilers such as [Microsoft Visual
C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [MinGW-w64](https://mingw-w64.org/)
and [TDM-GCC](https://jmeubank.github.io/tdm-gcc/).

Please notice that while 3.1.6 is officially a "development" version because
it is not fully compatible with the "stable" 3.0.x, the list of backwards
incompatible changes is very short, so you shouldn't have any problems
updating to this version from 3.0.x in practice, and you're encouraged to use
this release, including in production.

This is also the last release before the upcoming 3.2.0 release that will be
the start of a new API and ABI-stable wxWidgets version, so please test your
existing applications with this version and let us know about any problems
and, especially, regressions, so that they could still be fixed before 3.2.0.

### Changes in this release

In almost a year since the previous release, there have been more than 1700
commits from 82 unique contributors (41 with multiple contributions), so it is
impossible to summarize all the changes in this document without making it too
long, please see the [fuller changelog][1] for more (but still not all)
details, but some of the most important changes are:

[1]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/v3.1.6/docs/changes.txt

- New [wxBitmapBundle][2] class allowing to provide art work for both normal
  and high DPI in a simple way.
- New [wxUILocale][3] class replacing the old (but still available) wxLocale,
  but not suffering from its multiple problems and providing more
  functionality.
- Support for using native spell-checking in wxTextCtrl.
- Support for undo/redo in wxTextCtrl in wxOSX.
- Better drag-and-drop implementation in wxOSX.
- Fixes for important bugs in wxDataViewCtrl under all platforms.
- Many improvements and bug fixes for Wayland support in wxGTK.
- Support for the latest OS versions (Windows 11, macOS 12) and compilers (MSVS
  2022, gcc 12, clang 13).
- Project bug tracker has been moved to GitHub Issues.

Notice that in spite of all the changes, this release remains almost completely
compatible with 3.1.5 at the API level, so upgrading to it if you're already
using wxWidgets 3.1 should be straightforward.
