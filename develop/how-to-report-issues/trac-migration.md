title: "wxTrac has been migrated to GitHub Issues"
--- 

wxWidgets project previously used [Trac][1] installation at
`trac.wxwidgets.org`, known as wxTrac, for bug reporting, but since January
2022 wxTrac is not used any longer and all new bugs should be reported on
[GitHub][2]. Please see our [issue reporting guidelines][3] if you hadn't done
this before.

If you're looking for an existing bug report, you may find it at GitHub with
the same ticket number as before, e.g. the ticket previously found at
`http://trac.wxwidgets.org/ticket/12345` is now at
`https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/issues/12345`[^note]

If you don't have and can't, or don't want to, open a GitHub account required
to use GitHub Issues, or have any other questions about reporting issues in
wxWidgets, please post them to [our mailing lists][4].

[^note]: This is not true for the very old tickets with numbers strictly less
      than 2645 that are available as GitHub issues with numbers offset by
      19365, i.e. the old Trac ticket #1 is at
      `https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/issues/19366`, if, for some
      reason, you're still interested in them.
