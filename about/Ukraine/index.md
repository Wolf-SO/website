title: "Stop the War in Ukraine"
---

We call for an immediate stop of the senseless and barbaric Russian aggression
against Ukraine. Nothing can justify an unprovoked attack on another country,
shelling of its cities and civilian population. 

We stand with all the Ukrainians and, also, many Russians who are against this
war.

wxWidgets is a completely apolitical organization and has never expressed any
opinions about any of the, unfortunately numerous, conflicts and injustices
happening in the world. However I believe that the Russian invasion of Ukraine
is different both in scale and in the lack of any ambiguity about the role of
each side in the current events. Because of this I'd like to make an exception
to the usual rules and publish this short note.
